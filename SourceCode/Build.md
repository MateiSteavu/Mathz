It's a simple .NET application, I think you are perfectly capable of running this yourself.

Since this project was developed by me in the 10th grade of high school, it is obviously
utterly useless. It does not have anything remotely close to performance when compared to 
Wolfram Alpha (it is not even close), this project stands as a reminder that not just because
you can do something, you should do it.

Maybe you are a recruiter looking through my projects, this one is NOT impressive. This 
project stands as one of my many failures (yes, it works, yes, I developed it while I was 
14 or something like that, but I am not proud of it).
